# chrome_extension_tab_manager

## Manually load the chrome extension:

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
2. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your project directory.

Once the extension is published, I'll update instructions on how to download and install there.
