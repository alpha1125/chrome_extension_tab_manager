# chrome_extension_tab_manager

## Install via Chrome web store:
[Google Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/firstfire-window-merger/jgabbehjfmeolkgoafbmpimpaeajocmm)


## Manually load the Chrome extension:

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
2. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your project directory.

Notes:
* Firefox will not work, as it does not support the chrome extension API for tabGroups.
* Should work for all chromium based browsers.
